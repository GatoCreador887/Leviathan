Extension: levba

This filetype is used to play animations on rigged meshes (if there is suitable bone structure between animation and rig)


Leviathan Bone Animation File can be plain text (discussed first) or binary (discussed later on)

Header:
Contains information about the version of exporter and animation types

objects:
contains all of the animations (recommended to have 1 per file)

in this format

CHECK ModelFormat.txt FOR RULES OF FILE CONTENTS

hint: Don't uses tabs, use spaces. You can set notepad++ to replace tabs with spaces in the settings.
note: tabs might be supported in future versions


#### Example file ####
FileType: BoneAnimation;
ExporterVersion: 1.0;
Animation-Name = "DefaultModel_jump";
Base-Model-Name = "NameOfModelFromWhichThisAnimationWasCreated";
AnimationType = AnimTypeNormal; //key frame animation

// --------------- HEADER ENDS AFTER THIS LINE ------------- //
objects {
    o BoneAnimation "DefaultModel_base_RENAME" { // RENAME should really have a quite unique name
        l Properties {
            // info about animation
            KeyFrames = 250;
            KeyFrameInterval = 1;
            AnimationSpeed = 1000; // normal speed
            FrameLenght = 33333;// what ever the frame lenght is in microseconds for example if 30fps value is 3333,33333333333 don't actually put decimals, it breaks things
        }
        t Frame_FRAMENUMBER {
            // list of bones with their data at this frame
        
        }
    }
}

// file end, not required but you can make read end before last line
