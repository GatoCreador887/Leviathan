Extension: levmo

This filetype is to be used with levmd files that define models. This file format is used to store 
vertex data (normals, uv coordinates etc.) and animations (skeletal and morph target) + data that is
required by animations (bones, rigs). You will usually have just one levmd file and multiple levmo files
defining geometry datas for the invidiual parts of the model (or you can just have everything in one levmo file).

Leviathan Model Data File can be plain text (discussed first) or binary (discussed later on)

Header:
Contains information about the version of exporter and creator .etc

objects:
contains all of the invidual components of the model (bones, vertices, animations)

in this format

CHECK ModelFormat.txt FOR RULES OF FILE CONTENTS

hint: Don't uses tabs, use spaces. You can set notepad++ to replace tabs with spaces in the settings.
note: tabs might be supported in future versions
