Extension: levtd

This filetype is to be used with image files (dds, png, jpg etc.) to define their properties.
Most importantly are they normal images, bumpmaps, lightmaps or something else that requires
special treatment.

This filetype should always be saved as ascii 

Header:
Contains (almost) all information

objects:
contains blocks of special information (animated textures) that are rarely used

in this format

CHECK ModelFormat.txt FOR RULES OF FILE CONTENTS

hint: Don't uses tabs, use spaces. You can set notepad++ to replace tabs with spaces in the settings.
note: tabs might be supported in future versions of importers

Additional note: if you don't know something, you should, instead of leaving it out completely,
put it's value as CheckRequired

#### Example file ####
FileType: TextureDefinition;
Author: MyName;
Texture-Name = "My_Awesome_texture";
Texture-Type: NormalTexture;
// width in pixels //
Width = 200;
// height in pixels //
Height = 50;
ActualExtension = dds; // this is what the image file extension is 
// no animation
Animation = -1;
// OR
// if animation(s) are/is defined write the default animations name here
Animation = MyAnimation;

// --------------- HEADER ENDS AFTER THIS LINE ------------- //
objects {
    o AnimatedTexture "MyAnimation" {
        // not supported ... yet
        
    }
}

// file end, not required but you can make read end before last line
-!-
so that this doesn't cause any errors or
anything
